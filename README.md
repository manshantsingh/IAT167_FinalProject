IAT-167 Final Project

The game contains sprites I made based off of Red Ball 4 (Vol. 1/2). Music extracted from *Red Ball 4 Vol. 2*. Red Ball 1 game level designs inspired game levels.

Made for educational purposes :D

To play the game, just download and run [Final_Project.jar](https://github.com/manshantsingh/IAT167_FinalProject/raw/master/Final_Project.jar) file.
